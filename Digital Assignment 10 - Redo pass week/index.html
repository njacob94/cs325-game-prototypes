<h2>The Great Bookstore Heist</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>&nbsp;Two players play a more complex prisoner's dilemma and have to weight working together to avoid being caught with stealing the most books</li>
<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>&nbsp;Clickable Buttons, deterministic, competitive, Adventure</li>
<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>&nbsp;Players should&nbsp;be in a pyschological back and forth trying to decide when it is best to work together and when its best to stab each other in the back for more books</li>
<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>&nbsp;Each player can select 2 actions per turn from an array of actions. &nbsp;These have various effects from stealing more books to fleeing to the getaway car. &nbsp;At the end of a round the police try and stop them (odds are based on actions choosen earlier) and may or may not succeed&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>&nbsp;Make sure&nbsp;core gameplay&nbsp;loop works and work out any logic bugs (of which this game wound up with a lot of)&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Features:</strong>&nbsp;Simple&nbsp;interface and gameplay, but compelling core gameplay loop that forms the basis for a good game.</li>
<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>&nbsp;Two bookworms trying to heist books from a book store</li>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>&nbsp;Simple Text Game meant for two players</li>
<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>&nbsp;around 5 minutes, though bad luck early can end the game quickly</li>
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>&nbsp;Don't stab in the back to quickly or run the risk of not being safe enough to escape</li>
<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>&nbsp; Only assets were the buttons, which were done by me</li>
<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>&nbsp;This&nbsp;is a digital prototype, based on the analog game I made from 2 weeks ago. &nbsp;Still pretty buggy, but starting to come together.</li>
