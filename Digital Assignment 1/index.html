<h2>Whack the Asteroid</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>&nbsp;Click on the asteroid to whack it away from Danny the Cowboy, get points each time you do and you have 30 seconds to get as many as you can.</li>
<li><strong>Theme:</strong>&nbsp;Both Cowboys and Asteroids, the low res rock is indeed suppose to be an asteroid</li>
<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>&nbsp;Players click on the asteroid, velocity is randomized the genre is arcade like with a simple point and score timer.</li>
<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>&nbsp;Slighty frantic hurriedly trying to keep up with the bouncing</li>
<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>&nbsp;the player can click on the bouncing rock. &nbsp;Each time they do they get 10 points and the rock accelerates away from the cowboy at a random velocity. &nbsp;Players have 30 seconds to get as many points as they can before the timer stops and the rock freezes.</li>
<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>&nbsp;The goal of this prototype was mainly to learn how to use phaser, javascript and github (all 3 of which I had minimal experience with). &nbsp;Within the game itself I wanted to test the ability to randomize sprite movement and experiment with using multiple sprites.</li>
<li><strong>Features:</strong>&nbsp;Incredibly simple art that makes it immediatly itdentifiable (yes I'm reaching)</li>
<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>&nbsp;Danny the cowboy hates asteroids, keep clicking them to knock them away and get points! &nbsp;You only have 30 seconds to keep whacking that asteroid away before Danny can stop it. &nbsp;So rack up as many points as you can and brag about it to your friends!</li>
<li><strong>Story:</strong>&nbsp; The player will clearly experience a rollar coater of emotions. &nbsp;Danny's deep emotional blight is clear as his inevitable doom as symbolized by the incroaching asteroid. &nbsp;Only the hand of a mysterious force can keep it at bay. &nbsp;Love, hate and fear war for the players emotional attention as they frantically work to help Danny. &nbsp;Clearly an experience that will make bioshock look like a simplistic action experience by comparison. &nbsp;(In all seriousness, I was mostly focused on learning the engine this time).</li>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>&nbsp;People who want a competitive and fast pased experience.</li>
<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>&nbsp;30 seconds exactly</li>
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>&nbsp;floating the curser around the bottom of the screen can allow multiple clicks in a row racking up points quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>&nbsp;Two free online sources were used to find images. &nbsp;The cowboy one was edited to better fit the game
<ul>
<li>Cowboy: <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/29431961/Cowboy-Sprite-Sheet">Cowboy Sprite Sheet</a></li>
<li>Rock: <a href="http://superwalrusland.com/ohr/issue26/pa/pixelart.html">How to draw a rock</a></li>

</ul>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>&nbsp;No particular game was in mind for this one, but the genre of clicker games is an obvious influence. The main two examples from which code was either reused or modified were
<ul>
<li>Activate on Click: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/basics/02-click-on-an-image">Phaser Basic examples</a></li>
<li>Timer: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/time/custom-timert">Phaser Basic Examples</a></li>
