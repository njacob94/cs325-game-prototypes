<h2>Rock Paper Scissors Draw 4</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>&nbsp;3 Players take turns placing marks on a grid like in tic tac toe, the first to draw 4 in a row wins, but players can each delete each other marks.</li>
<li><strong>Theme:</strong>&nbsp;Special dispensation to use my previous analog game</li>
<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>&nbsp;Clickable Buttons, Deterministic, Competitor, Puzzle</li>
<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>&nbsp;Quick and easy to play game when with friends</li>
<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>&nbsp;Each player takes turns placing a Rock/Paper/Scissor mark on the grid, the first player to draw 4 in a row wins. &nbsp;As a twist if a mark get surrounded on 2 sides by a mark that deletes it (for example paper gets surrounded by scissors) then the mark is deleted and removed. &nbsp;In addition a mark can be protected if it is surrounded by at least 2 of the same mark.</li>
<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>&nbsp;Make sure all grid mechanics work as intended. &nbsp;Make sure the system can search the grid and detect stuff like 4 in a row, and when a mark is surrounded. &nbsp;The next iteration would hopefully have a smoother clickable interface and animations showing when marks are safe/deleted</li>
<li><strong>Features:</strong>&nbsp;Simple rules, but allow some degree of 3 player compitition</li>
<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>&nbsp;No real setting at the moment, but I do think the theme could work with some sort of stratagy game involving placing castles/soldiers.</li>
<li><strong>Story:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;No story at the moment, this game is intended for compitition amoung friends.</li>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>&nbsp;3 friends who want a quick game to play together</li>
<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>&nbsp;around 1 minute to 2 minutes, depending on play style</li>
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>&nbsp;Trying to create a box of 2x2 of one mark often gives you an advantage I've found</li>
<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>&nbsp;All art was made by me (should be obvious from the very simple design). &nbsp;No other assets used. &nbsp;Though the second iteration might include some sound effects for deleting and protecting marks</li>
<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>&nbsp;No particular closest game other then a modified version of tic tac toe</li>
</ul>
